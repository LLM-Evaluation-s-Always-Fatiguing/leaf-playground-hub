## Introduction

This is a "Who is the spy" game simulation project.

"Who is the spy" is a language game whose participants are: a moderator and some players. For the players, there are: some civilians, one or two spies, and sometimes there is also one blank (who will not get any clue at the start of the game). The number of players are ranged from 4 to 9.

The moderator controls the game process by assign role and respect clue to each player, ask them to: describe the clue they get, vote to eliminate one player who they think may be another side, check if one side wins and announce winners.

For civilians, they need to eliminate all spies (and blank if exists in the game) to win the game.

For spies and blank, they need to find a way to cover their identities when give the description of their clue, so that to survive in the game till the last round to win.
